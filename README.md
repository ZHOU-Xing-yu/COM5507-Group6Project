# Web3 Development Trend and Advice on Job Seeking: Base on Data Mining of Job Postings on a Web3 Career Site

**Abstract**

Based on data mining from a job site endorsed by industry insiders, this study is dedicated to perceiving the development dynamics of the industry as a whole by cutting through the microscopic perspective. We found that the industry is currently at the beginning stage of healthy development and is in great need of technical talents and non-technical talents who are good at top-level design and proficient in finance, cryptocurrency, NFT, blockchain, and marketing, while a large number of internship positions exist and are friendly to candidates with no experience. Meanwhile, this study also finds that the trend of decentralization is emerging, but North America is still in the lead with its technological advantages, and East Asia, especially Hong Kong SAR and mainland China, has greater potential for development with its huge population and consumer market.
