This revolution is being fuelled by decentralized finance (or DeFi for short), which is enabling an assortment of pioneering developers and entrepreneurs to re-invent almost every financial product that is currently traded and invested in traditional markets, without requiring central authorities or siloed infrastructure. DeFi has captured a great deal of attention and investment in the crypto-aware niche, growing assets under management from $1 billion to over $200 billion in a few years. Impressive as its growth has been, its current market size isn't even a rounding error on the over $400 trillion held in traditional finance. We're focused on what it will take to go from billions to trillions.RDX went back to first principles to come up with the right technical solution—the first layer-one protocol built specifically for mainstream DeFi—and we have already tested out at over 1 million transactions per second. We're keenly aware that the need for an infinitely scalable platform is only one prerequisite among many for mass adoption, and we're also blazing new ground in the areas of purpose-built developer tools, user experiences, and regulatory integration.We have forged a path deep into the future of what distributed ledger technology is going to look like and we need you to come and be part of the team that is making that happen right now.If this job sounds like it was made for you, then please apply directly via the link or if you don’t have an up-to-date CV to apply with, please contact[email\\xa0protected]for more information.Check out our company benefits here - RDX Works BenefitsAlternatively, if you feel like you don’t match all of the requirements, we would love you to still apply anyway.

We're modernizing an antiquated, fractured space and democratizing access to investment management for talented retail traders and traditional emerging managers alike.Founded in 2021, Repool is a Y Combinator S21 fintech with $3.7M seed round from firms like Canaan, Matrix, and Global Founders Capital, as well as angel investors including founders from unicorns like Brex, Jeeves, Mercury, Flexport, Outschool, Pilot, and Forge, and VPs from Goldman Sachs, Barclays, and Bank of America.We're currently 7 employees split between NYC and SF.THE ROLE:We're looking for a talented writer to join our content and marketing team. You'll be responsible for writing high-quality, thoughtful, and engaging content for Repool's 'regular' blog and our market commentary site. We aim to provide entertaining content (think the readability and engagement of viral content on WallStreetBets, but more proefssional) with insights and quality not commonly available to the regular public (i.e. we think Seeking Alpha, MarketWatch, etc produce very mediocre content).You'll work closely with Jess, who spent 8 years at Goldman Sachs as a trader, most recently on the IG Credit desk, and Clair, our VP of Marketing.This role is ideal for someone early to mid-career with a passion for investing and finance, deep research, and high intellectual horsepower. Pay and equity relative to the content writing space will be extremely competitive.WHAT YOU'LL DO HEREOn a weekly to bi-weekly cadence, you'll write educational, sophisticated content such as market primers that cover key investing concepts, or opinionated, data-driven commentary on market trends and happenings.On a closer-to-daily-but-not-necessarily-daily cadence, you'll write shorter, entertaining content about finance and crypto happeningsWork with the marketing team to help drive viewership and newsletter/blog subscriber acquisition(optional) As an early stage startup, one of the benefits is wearing multiple hats/getting wide exposure, and if you want that, we are happy to find ways to help you gain exposure wider than content writing if you desire.THE RIGHT CANDIDATE WILL HAVE:Experience: At least 2 years of full-time, post-college professional experience, not necessarily, but ideally in a content/research oriented roleWillingness to learn: You'll need to become a formidable expert in the finance, trading, and crypto space; naturally, we don't expect anyone to come in at the level we want them to get to over timeExcellent writing skills: Writing concise, intelligent, and highly readable content is second nature to you.Creativity: Our goal is to create a content brand and content strategy that we think doesn't exist, so simply mirroring other players won't suffice.

       " \"We are Acria a company with the mission to bring the blockchain scene a huge step forward. One of the most pressing issues when developing smart contracts is the lack of real-world data. But due to technical limitations, such as the consensus protocol, no blockchain has been able to solve this major limitation.The Acria Network aims to solve exactly this problem with the help of so-called oracle nodes. In addition to that, it aims to implement cross-chain support in order to supply various blockchains with real-world data. Cross-chain functionality will be achieved via the Polkadot ecosystem and Ethereum.An important advantage of the Acria Network compared to common solutions is the complete lack of middlemen. This in turn increases the quality and trustworthiness of the data provided.The existing solutions offered to provide blockchains with real-world data heavily rely on oracles which function as middlemen that only supply real-world data that is available via various APIs.This heavily limits the amount of data that can be utilized as well as the trustworthiness of the data provided via those solutions.We are looking for an energetic addition to our business development team to support our daily activities as well as take part in our strategy meetings to implement the received customer feedback.

But due to technical limitations, such as the consensus protocol, no blockchain has been able to solve this major limitation.The Acria Network aims to solve exactly this problem with the help of so-called oracle nodes. In addition to that, it aims to implement cross-chain support in order to supply various blockchains with real-world data. Cross-chain functionality will be achieved via the Polkadot ecosystem and Ethereum.An important advantage of the Acria Network compared to common solutions is the complete lack of middlemen.

       " \"We are Acria a company with the mission to bring the blockchain scene a huge step forward. One of the most pressing issues when developing smart contracts is the lack of real-world data. But due to technical limitations, such as the consensus protocol, no blockchain has been able to solve this major limitation.The Acria Network aims to solve exactly this problem with the help of so-called oracle nodes. In addition to that, it aims to implement cross-chain support in order to supply various blockchains with real-world data. Cross-chain functionality will be achieved via the Polkadot ecosystem and Ethereum.An important advantage of the Acria Network compared to common solutions is the complete lack of middlemen. This in turn increases the quality and trustworthiness of the data provided.The existing solutions offered to provide blockchains with real-world data heavily rely on oracles which function as middlemen that only supply real-world data that is available via various APIs.This heavily limits the amount of data that can be utilized as well as the trustworthiness of the data provided via those solutions.We are looking for an energetic addition to our business development team to support our daily activities as well as take part in our strategy meetings to implement the received customer feedback.

       " \"One of our key aims at Founders Factory is making the process of launching a startup more accessible. To do that, we mitigate the biggest risks for entrepreneurs from all backgrounds and give them the support they need to thrive and grow. We believe that by partnering with you, the world’s best entrepreneurs, we can build technology companies that solve our world's biggest challenges. We’ve spent years perfecting a platform that shortcuts and de-risks building a business from scratch. We bring together bold ideas, exceptional entrepreneurs, capital, expert operational support, and the scale of our corporate partners, to turn bold ideas into back-able businesses.To put it simply, our Venture Studio is a fast-track for entrepreneurs to go from idea to scale. Together we will 1) validate ideas, 2) build the MVP and 3) test, iterate and acquire first customers. And when we’re confident that we’ve proven the concept (typically after 6-months), we’ll help you accelerate your launch with an additional cash injection.One of the newest concepts we are building in our studio is Project Lime.🧐 The Problem:The shift to Decentralised Finance is gathering unstoppable momentum with the benefits of Blockchain starting to deliver on the promise of truly decentralised risk-sharing systems in retail and corporate markets. But things can still go wrong and insurance products that protect against these risk events are lagging behind. To fully unlock the potential of crypto and decentralised finance, a strong insurance ecosystem is needed to underwrite smart contract-linked risk.💰 So what is Lime?Lime unlocks DeFi insurance for the masses. Lime is a member-based insurance market where retail and institutional clients can transfer crypto-related risk to yield- seeking investors. Lime leverages DLT to develop true P2P insurance models where previous inefficiencies, such as a lack of solidarity between policyholders, are directly solved by trustless blockchains. Lime has two primary products. Lime Creator helps protocols, web 3 organisations and DAOs to insure their systems by opening a decentralised insurance pool. Lime Market is a platform where private and institutional investors can provide capital to on-chain insurance pools.💸 The Vision:The vision for Lime is to create the next generation of cyber insurance by building an automated De-Fi insurance market. Lime enables DeFi protocols, dApps and custodians to offer insurance options directly on their platform and provide simple and easy DeFi insurance for crypto investors. Lime combines the benefits of Peer-to-peer community led risk pooling, embedded insurance and automated parametric claims to protect risks for the next billion Crypto users.📈 Unfair advantage:Founders Factory is working closely with our corporate partner Aviva on Project Lime due to the huge potential to create a new category of insurance. Aviva will bring its actuarial expertise, regulatory experience and financial clout as unfair advantages to the venture ensuring Lime is future proofed for scale.As our first founder, you will:Execute the successful build and launch of LimeSet a clear vision for the business (including product direction)Activate distribution partnerships and supercharge growthHave strong Data, Product and/or Engineering experienceHave a passion for innovation in the insurance marketIdeally have experience of working within InsurtechHave experience in a leadership capacity (you love challenges and solving complex problems)Be constantly experimenting with new technologies and tools to drive innovation and creativityBe brilliant at hiring and retaining a world class team beyond the foundersBring together industry partners to create sizeable unfair advantageWhat you'll get:In 6 months, we'll help you validate, build and launch an MVP.

In addition to that, it aims to implement cross-chain support in order to supply various blockchains with real-world data.
